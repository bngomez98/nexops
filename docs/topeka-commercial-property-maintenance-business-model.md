## Executive Summary

Nexus Operations LLC provides outsourced maintenance coordination services to multi-family property management companies in Topeka, Kansas. The company guarantees verified contractor response within defined timeframes, eliminating the coordination burden that consumes property manager time and delays essential repairs.

### Business Structure

- **Entity:** Kansas Limited Liability Company (Member-Managed)
- **Formation Date:** January 15, 2026
- **Principal Office:** 405 SW Fillmore St, Topeka, KS 66606
- **Registered Agent:** Brianna Gomez

### Revenue Model

The company operates on a cost-plus markup model. Property management clients submit maintenance requests through standardized intake channels. Nexus Operations coordinates pre-verified contractors to complete the work, then invoices clients for contractor costs plus a 25-35% service markup depending on job complexity and urgency category.

## Market Analysis

### Geographic Market Definition

Nexus Operations serves Shawnee County, Kansas, with primary focus on Topeka city limits and immediately adjacent incorporated areas. This geographic scope ensures contractor response times under 45 minutes for emergency requests while maintaining operational efficiency.

### Market Demographics

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Shawnee County Population | 178,000 |
| Total Housing Units | 76,000 |
| Renter-Occupied Units | 28,000 |
| Multi-Family Properties (5+ units) | 18,000-22,000 units |
| Median Household Income | $52,000 |

### Target Customer Profile

#### Primary: Property Management Companies

Property management firms managing 100-800 units across multiple properties represent the primary customer segment. These companies face chronic maintenance coordination challenges including:

- Maintenance staff turnover rates of 35-50% annually requiring continuous recruiting and training
- Emergency coordination consuming 8-15 hours of property manager time weekly
- Tenant satisfaction declining due to delayed repair response times
- Properties under 200 units unable to economically justify full-time maintenance staff earning $3,500-4,500 monthly plus benefits

Decision makers are property managers or operations directors with budget authority to approve $2,000-5,000 monthly operational expenses without owner approval for properties they manage.

#### Secondary: Individual Property Owners

Individual owners managing 50-200 unit complexes without dedicated property management firms face similar coordination challenges with greater intensity due to lack of dedicated staff. These owners have direct profit and loss responsibility and demonstrate high cost sensitivity but value time savings and operational reliability.

### Addressable Market Quantification

The Topeka property management landscape consists of 12-18 firms managing multi-family residential properties. The top 6-8 companies collectively manage 4,000-7,000 units. Remaining firms manage 50-400 units each. Individual landlords manage the balance of rental units but represent a fragmented customer base requiring different acquisition approaches.

### Penetration Targets

| Period | Client Count | Units Under Management |
|---|---|---|
| Year 1 Target | 3-4 clients | 800-1,500 units |
| Year 2 Target | 6-8 clients | 1,800-3,000 units |
| Market Saturation | 10-12 clients | 3,500-5,000 units |

## Service Delivery Model

### Service Offering

Nexus Operations coordinates all maintenance and repair requirements for client properties through a network of pre-verified contractors. The company guarantees contractor response within defined timeframes based on urgency categorization, eliminates coordination burden from property management staff, and ensures work completion through automated backup assignment protocols.

### Response Time Guarantees

| Urgency Category | Contractor Assignment | On-Site Arrival |
|---|---|---|
| Emergency | 1 hour | 4 hours |
| Urgent | 4 hours | Next business day |
| Routine | 24 hours | 3-5 business days |

### Operational Workflow

#### Request Intake

Property managers submit maintenance requests through phone, text message, or email providing: property address, unit number, issue description, urgency category, and tenant availability. Nexus Operations acknowledges receipt within 15 minutes during business hours (8:00 AM - 6:00 PM Monday-Friday) and immediately for emergency requests outside business hours.

#### Contractor Assignment

The company assigns contractors based on trade requirements, geographic proximity, current workload capacity, and historical performance metrics. Assigned contractors receive immediate notification with complete request details and respond within timeframes specified by urgency category. If assigned contractors decline or fail to respond within required timeframes, automated reassignment to backup contractors occurs without client notification.

#### Work Completion and Quality Assurance

Contractors complete assigned work and submit photos plus work descriptions to Nexus Operations. The company confirms work completion with property managers before processing contractor payment. Property managers have 48 business hours to raise quality concerns; after this period, work is considered accepted and contractor payment is processed.

#### Invoicing and Payment

Nexus Operations invoices clients monthly for all completed work during the billing period. Invoices detail each service request including date, property address, work performed, contractor cost, and service markup. Standard payment terms are Net 15 for established clients and Net 7 for new clients during the first 90 days. Contractors receive payment within 3-5 business days of client payment receipt.

## Contractor Network Management

### Contractor Recruitment and Verification

Nexus Operations maintains a network of pre-verified contractors across essential maintenance trades. Initial network development targets 15-20 contractors providing geographic and trade coverage for client needs. Contractor recruitment focuses on established businesses with 2-10 employees demonstrating operational stability without excessive growth constraints.

### Verification Requirements

All contractors must provide and maintain:

- Current Kansas business license and applicable trade-specific licenses (electrical, plumbing, HVAC)
- General liability insurance with minimum $500,000 per occurrence and $1,000,000 aggregate coverage
- Workers compensation insurance if employing staff
- Three verifiable business references from commercial or property management clients
- Background check clearance for business principals

Nexus Operations conducts annual reverification of all licenses and insurance certificates with 60-day advance notification of expiration dates.

### Performance Management

The company tracks contractor performance across multiple dimensions:

- Response time to assignment notifications
- Attendance rate for accepted assignments
- Work completion reliability without requiring follow-up visits
- Client satisfaction ratings based on property manager feedback
- Pricing consistency and reasonableness relative to market rates

Contractors falling below minimum standards (85% attendance rate for accepted assignments, 4.0+ average satisfaction rating on 5.0 scale) receive performance warnings and improvement expectations. Persistent underperformance results in network removal. This quality enforcement differentiates the Nexus Operations contractor network from unvetted platform alternatives and supports premium positioning with commercial clients.

### Contractor Compensation

Contractors receive their full quoted rates for completed work. Nexus Operations does not reduce contractor compensation; the service markup is added to contractor rates when invoicing clients. This compensation structure maintains contractor economic relationships while ensuring company profitability.

Payment processing occurs within 3-5 business days of client payment receipt. Contractors can track payment status through monthly statements detailing completed work, invoice dates, client payment dates, and remittance amounts.

## Revenue Model and Pricing

### Cost-Plus Markup Structure

Nexus Operations generates revenue through service markups applied to contractor work performed for clients. The company does not charge upfront retainers or subscription fees, reducing client acquisition friction and aligning revenue directly with service delivery volume.

### Standard Markup Rates

| Service Category | Markup Percentage | Example (Contractor Cost) |
|---|---|---|
| Routine Maintenance | 25% | $300 → $375 |
| Urgent Repairs | 30% | $500 → $650 |
| Emergency Response | 35% | $800 → $1,080 |

Markup percentages reflect coordination complexity and urgency-driven operational costs. Emergency responses require immediate contractor mobilization and often occur outside standard business hours, justifying higher service fees. Clients understand and accept higher markups for urgent situations where rapid response prevents property damage escalation or tenant safety issues.

### Revenue Projections

Revenue projections assume conservative client acquisition rates and typical maintenance volume patterns for multi-family properties in the Topeka market.

#### Year 1 Monthly Revenue Progression

| Quarter | Active Clients | Avg Monthly Revenue | Quarterly Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 (Months 1-3) | 1 | $2,500 | $7,500 |
| Q2 (Months 4-6) | 2 | $5,000 | $15,000 |
| Q3 (Months 7-9) | 3 | $7,000 | $21,000 |
| Q4 (Months 10-12) | 3-4 | $8,000 | $24,000 |
| **Year 1 Total** |  |  | **$67,500** |

## Financial Operations

### Operating Expenses

Nexus Operations maintains minimal fixed overhead, focusing resources on client acquisition and service delivery rather than administrative infrastructure.

#### Monthly Fixed Costs

| Expense Category | Monthly Cost |
|---|---|
| Business insurance (general liability and E&O) | $100 |
| Software subscriptions (Airtable, QuickBooks, communication tools) | $150 |
| Business phone line and communication services | $50 |
| Banking fees and transaction costs | $40 |
| **Total Monthly Fixed Costs** | **$340** |

### Variable Costs

Variable costs consist primarily of contractor verification expenses during network expansion ($25-50 per contractor onboarded) and payment processing fees (approximately 1-2% of revenue for ACH transfers and check processing). These costs scale proportionally with business growth and remain manageable through the first 12 months of operations.

### Profitability Analysis

#### Break-Even Calculation

Monthly fixed costs of $340 plus variable costs of approximately 2% of revenue establish break-even at $1,700-2,000 monthly revenue. This threshold is achievable within 60-90 days through a single commercial client generating moderate maintenance volume, demonstrating minimal financial risk and rapid path to positive cash flow.

#### Margin Progression

| Monthly Revenue | Net Profit | Profit Margin |
|---|---|---|
| $2,500 | $1,110 | 44% |
| $5,000 | $2,960 | 59% |
| $8,000 | $5,320 | 67% |
| $12,000 | $8,520 | 71% |

Margin expansion results from fixed cost leverage as coordination efficiency improves without proportional expense increases. At $12,000 monthly revenue, the business generates $8,520 monthly profit ($102,240 annually) with minimal capital investment and no external financing requirements.

### Cash Flow Management

Payment timing creates working capital requirements that must be managed carefully during growth phases. Property managers typically require Net 15 payment terms, while contractors expect payment within 3-5 business days of client payment receipt. This creates a timing gap where the company must front contractor payment before receiving client funds.

At $8,000 monthly revenue, approximately $6,000 represents contractor costs that must be paid before client payment receipt. With Net 15 terms, maximum cash exposure is $3,000-4,500 depending on billing cycle timing. The business requires sufficient working capital reserves to cover this gap without relying on external financing.

Strategies for managing cash flow timing include: negotiating faster client payment terms during initial relationship establishment, maintaining cash reserves equivalent to one billing cycle of contractor costs, and potentially offering early payment discounts (1-2%) to clients who remit within 7 days.

## 90-Day Implementation Plan

The following implementation plan focuses exclusively on commercial client acquisition and foundational operations, deliberately excluding residential marketplace development until commercial revenue provides sustainable business foundation.

### Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-30)

#### Administrative Setup (Days 1-7)

Complete all business formation requirements including EIN registration, business banking establishment with BlueVine, general liability and errors and omissions insurance procurement, and QuickBooks accounting system configuration. Establish business phone line and professional email address. Total investment: $1,000-1,500.

#### Contractor Network Development (Days 8-21)

Identify 25-30 contractors across essential trades through Google Maps, Kansas state licensing databases, and direct observation of work trucks and signage. Prioritize contractors with 2-10 employees who have been in business 3+ years. Conduct phone outreach explaining the guaranteed commercial work opportunity with rapid payment. Target: recruit 10-15 contractors willing to participate with verification completion. Document contractor profiles including service categories, geographic coverage, and contact information.

#### First Client Acquisition (Days 22-30)

Identify 10-15 property management companies in Topeka through Shawnee County property records and commercial real estate listings. Call operations managers directly explaining the maintenance coordination service value proposition. Offer one property management company a free 30-day trial covering all maintenance requests at cost with no markup. During trial, manually coordinate every maintenance request demonstrating response times, completion rates, and time savings. Document all metrics including number of requests, average response time, completion percentage, and property manager time saved compared to their previous process.

### Phase 2: Revenue Generation (Days 31-60)

#### Trial Conversion and Client Expansion (Days 31-45)

Present trial results to client showing documented response time improvements and coordination time savings compared to their previous process. Propose ongoing service agreement with 25-30% markup structure based on property size and historical maintenance volume. Target: convert trial client to paying contract at $2,000-3,000 monthly revenue. Simultaneously conduct outreach to 2-3 additional property management companies using trial success metrics and client testimonial. Offer 30-day trial at 50% markup for prospects hesitant to commit immediately.

#### Operational Infrastructure Development (Days 46-60)

Formalize relationships with contractors who performed well during trial through written service agreements covering payment terms, response time expectations, and insurance requirements. Build minimal operational infrastructure using Airtable for request tracking, contractor assignment, and completion monitoring. Create standardized intake forms for property manager request submission. Document standard operating procedures based on trial period learnings including request categorization criteria, contractor assignment logic, quality assurance protocols, and invoicing process. This documentation enables consistent operations and eventual staff expansion if needed.

### Phase 3: Scaling and Stabilization (Days 61-90)

#### Client Base Expansion (Days 61-75)

Target acquiring one additional paying client to reach 2-3 total clients generating $4,000-6,000 monthly revenue. Continue direct outreach to property management companies emphasizing proven track record with existing clients and documented operational metrics. Adjust service pricing based on actual costs and operational learnings from first 60 days. Consider offering tiered pricing based on property size or guaranteed response time requirements to address different client budget constraints.

#### Performance Analysis and Strategic Planning (Days 76-90)

Analyze first 90 days data to identify: which service categories have optimal contractor supply and demand balance, which client acquisition approaches produced highest conversion rates at lowest cost, which operational processes require automation investment versus remaining manual, and whether pricing structure achieves target profit margins given actual costs. Use these insights to create detailed 6-month operational plan for months 4-9 incorporating validated learnings. Determine whether to: continue manual operations through month 6 before technology investment, expand into adjacent geographic markets, adjust service category focus based on supply and demand patterns, or raise additional capital for accelerated growth versus continued bootstrapped organic expansion.

### Target 90-Day Outcome

Successfully achieve $4,000-7,000 monthly recurring revenue through 2-3 commercial clients, establish verified contractor network of 12-18 active contractors, document operational procedures enabling consistent service delivery, and validate core business model profitability before considering residential marketplace expansion or geographic market expansion.

## Risk Factors and Mitigation Strategies

### Operational Risks

#### Contractor Supply Constraints

**Risk:** Insufficient contractor participation or availability creates service delivery failures that damage client relationships and company reputation.

**Mitigation:** Recruit contractors before generating significant client demand through initial trial period approach. Maintain 2:1 contractor-to-active-client ratio ensuring redundancy when contractors are unavailable. Develop backup contractor networks willing to accept overflow assignments at premium rates during capacity constraints. Monitor fulfillment rates weekly and pause new client acquisition if completion rates drop below 85%. Establish clear contractor performance standards with removal procedures for persistent underperformance.

#### Quality Control and Client Satisfaction

**Risk:** Contractor no-shows, poor workmanship, or unprofessional behavior damage platform reputation and terminate client contracts.

**Mitigation:** Implement rigorous contractor verification before network admission including license verification, insurance confirmation, reference calls, and background screening. Track contractor performance across multiple dimensions with automatic warnings and removal for persistent underperformance. Maintain automated reassignment capability ensuring service delivery even when individual contractors fail. Structure client contracts with service level guarantees including fee rebates for missed response times creating accountability. Obtain errors and omissions insurance protecting against liability for contractor actions.

### Financial Risks

#### Working Capital Requirements

**Risk:** Payment timing gaps between contractor payment obligations and client payment receipt create cash flow constraints preventing business operations.

**Mitigation:** Maintain cash reserves equivalent to one full billing cycle of contractor costs (approximately $3,000-5,000 at target revenue levels). Negotiate faster payment terms during initial client relationship establishment. Offer early payment discounts (1-2%) to clients who remit within 7 days. Consider establishing business line of credit after 6 months of operational history to cover temporary timing gaps without equity dilution.

#### Client Concentration

**Risk:** Heavy revenue concentration in 2-3 clients creates vulnerability to single client loss significantly impacting business viability.

**Mitigation:** Maintain active pipeline of prospective clients even after reaching initial revenue targets. Structure client contracts with 60-90 day termination notice requirements providing time to replace lost revenue. Deliver exceptional service quality maintaining high client retention rates. Diversify across multiple property management companies rather than concentrating in single large client. Plan for 4-6 clients minimum before considering business stable and sustainable.

### Market Risks

#### Seasonal Demand Variation

**Risk:** Extreme seasonality in maintenance categories (HVAC peaks during temperature extremes, roofing peaks in summer) creates revenue volatility and contractor retention challenges during slow periods.

**Mitigation:** Diversify across service categories with offsetting seasonal patterns. Commercial maintenance provides year-round baseline demand cushioning residential volatility if that segment is eventually added. Build cash reserves during peak revenue months to cover operational expenses during seasonal troughs. Establish clear expectations with contractors about seasonal demand patterns during recruitment. Monitor month-over-month revenue trends and adjust contractor network size accordingly.

#### Competitive Response

**Risk:** National platforms or well-funded competitors enter Topeka market with superior resources and undercut pricing.

**Mitigation:** Focus on mid-sized markets where national platforms have limited presence and margins too thin for aggressive competitive response. Build contractor loyalty through superior economics and transparent operations that large platforms cannot replicate due to overhead structure. Emphasize relationship-based service and local market knowledge as differentiation from automated national platforms. Establish strong commercial client relationships with multi-year contracts creating switching costs. Accept that long-term success may involve acquisition by larger platform recognizing operational innovations rather than perpetual independence.
