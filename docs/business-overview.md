## 1 — EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Nexus Operations is an exclusive contractor marketplace based in Topeka, Kansas, that fundamentally restructures how property owners connect with licensed contractors. The platform assigns each submitted project to exactly one verified contractor on an exclusive basis that ideally spans to ongoing projects through Nexus' network.

The vendor and maintenance managed services industry is dominated by platforms built on a lead-sharing model: one property owner's request is sold to multiple contractors simultaneously, generating revenue for the platform while creating a chaotic experience for both property owners and contractors. Nexus Operations replaces that model with exclusive assignment, complete documentation, and 24-hour consultation confirmation. Guaranteed.

**Current State:**
- Pre-revenue with functional platform
- 97 property management company pipeline
- 30+ contractor leads ready for outreach
- $390/month current operational overhead

**The Investment Opportunity:**
- Raising pre-seed capital
- 18-month runway to operational self-sufficiency
- Break-even at Month 12 with 25 active contractors
- $11,325 MRR (monthly revenue rate) at break-even vs. $9,090 monthly operating expense (~$2,000 surplus)
- Second-market expansion viable by Month 18

**Why Now:**

The first 10 completed projects are the highest-priority business development activity in the first 90 days. Each produces a documented outcome that serves as a case study for subsequent conversions. Those 10 verified outcomes are the most valuable asset the company can produce before the next investor conversation.

## 2 — THE COMPANY

| | |
|---|---|
| **Company Name** | Nexus Operations, LLC |
| **Founded** | 2025 |
| **Headquarters** | Topeka, Kansas |
| **Entity Type** | Kansas Limited Liability Company |
| **Website** | nexusoperations.org |

**Mission:**
To make contractor sourcing efficient, transparent, and fair—for the people who need work done and for the professionals who do it. Relieving our clients of operational cost and labor inefficiencies that jeopardize their long term revenue and property values.

**Vision:**
Nexus Operations will become the primary contractor coordination platform for property managers, landlords, and real estate operators across the Heartland region, starting in Topeka and expanding to Wichita, Kansas City, and Omaha within 36 months of Series A funding.

**Core Values:**
- **Exclusivity is non-negotiable** — One project, one contractor, mechanically enforced
- **Documentation is default** — Every project generates a complete, timestamped audit trail
- **Verification is mandatory** — No contractor accesses the platform without license, insurance, and background confirmation
- **Transparency before contact** — Budget ceilings are visible to contractors before they claim a project

### Leadership

**Brianna Gomez — Chief Executive Member, Founder**
Brianna brings cross-functional experience in technology infrastructure, government IT operations, analytical systems, and human services. She developed and conceptualized the Nexus platform, and understands both its technical foundation and how to develop a managed maintenance service. Her experience supports the full scope of founding responsibilities—defining the service, making technical and operational decisions, with a people-first understanding. She has experience across both the technical and operational sides of the business, allowing decisions to be made efficiently, and carried through without loss of accuracy.

**Damon Ray — Authorized Member, Director of Operations**
Damon leads operations and is the first contractor in the network, licensed in HVAC with experience across many domains. His background across HVAC, construction, and skilled labor reflects direct experience with how maintenance and trade work is performed. He applies that understanding to how work is assigned, communicated, and completed, maintaining expectations that are practical and enforceable. This supports consistent execution and reliability across the service as it expands.

**Riley — Business Development Manager**
Riley leads business development and is responsible for establishing and sustaining participation across the network. Her background in direct sales and cold outreach supports a high volume of engagement across contractors, vendors, and property stakeholders. She builds rapport quickly, communicates with clarity and control, and maintains persistence across extended outreach cycles. This allows her to convert initial contact into active participation and maintain those relationships over time, directly supporting the growth and continuity required for the service to function.

**Why This Team:**
The Topeka market wasn't selected randomly as a test case—it's where we are rooted. Our founders have direct connections with the property management community, contractor network, and local businesses. This network accelerates contractor acquisition and property manager outreach in ways that an external team cannot match. Our Heartland connection is more than just a talking point; it's a fundamental advantage.

## 3 — MARKET PROBLEM AND OPPORTUNITY

The industry operates on a volume-based model, where multiple contractors compete for the same lead simultaneously. This approach financially benefits the platforms but does not advantage the property owner who makes a request, or the contractor who invests time pursuing work that many others are also chasing. Alternatively, they rely on word of mouth and other traditional methods for securing leads.

### The Property Owner Experience (Use Case)

A property manager submits a roofing repair request to a major platform. Within minutes, four to six contractors call. Each has paid for that same lead. None of them have complete information about the scope, budget expectations, or timeline. The property manager must repeat the same information to each contractor, field competing sales pitches, and attempt to evaluate qualifications based on limited and unverified information. No documentation is produced. No audit trail exists. The decision is made based on whoever called first, sounded most convincing, or quoted the lowest price—not based on verified qualifications or fit.

### The Contractor Experience (Use Case)

A licensed roofing contractor pays $40 to $80 for a lead. When they call, they discover three other contractors are calling the same property owner at the same time. The property owner is overwhelmed and non-responsive. The contractor invests 30 to 45 minutes attempting to make contact, schedule a consultation, and assess the project—only to learn the property owner selected someone else who quoted $200 less. The contractor paid for a lead they had a one-in-four chance of winning and received no compensation for the time invested in assessment.

### Market Consequences

A measurable segment of the Topeka property management market has abandoned platforms entirely and returned to direct contractor relationships. Not because they prefer managing those relationships, but because the platform experience was worse than the problem it claimed to solve. These property managers represent the "refusing non-customer"—a group that requires a conversation explicitly acknowledging their rejection of technology that hinders their growth, rather than building it. This is why Nexus Operations is uniquely different from what they rejected: we are not just an app, we are a partner with a human-centered approach. This outpaces large scale applications like Angi, or HouseCallPro.

### The Problem

This is not a user experience problem that can be solved with better design or faster response times. It is an incentive problem built into the target market's willingness to work with us. Other similar platforms profit by selling the same lead to as many contractors as possible. They cannot introduce exclusivity without eliminating 70 to 80 percent of their lead revenue. Their business model cannot be fixed from inside. It must be replaced.

### The Opportunity

Nexus Operations occupies a differentiated position that other platforms cannot replicate without destroying their own business models. The exclusive assignment mechanic is not a feature—it is the foundation of an entirely different marketplace structure. This creates a competitive edge on the product (software) side, and positions Nexus Operations to acquire the market share of property managers and contractors who have already rejected the existing alternatives.

## 4 — THE NEXUS OPERATIONS SOLUTION

Nexus Operations is a two-sided marketplace, and managed maintenance service that provides an ongoing network of vetted vendors who can supply the skilled labor necessary to maintain the properties and homes of our clients. The moment a contractor claims a specific project, they are provided with the support to convert each one into a lucrative opportunity that could potentially go beyond the initial work they provide. Managers, Homeowners, and other Property owners are relieved of managing their own staff, recruiting vendors, and other cost and time intensive aspects of the maintenance lifecycle. Nexus handles it with end-to-end documentation and transparency, providing the owner with full control while allowing them to avoid burnout for both themselves and their employees or staff.

### What Nexus Operations Is

- A managed marketplace where property owners submit complete project documentation with specifications and times they are available, as well as their absolute budget limits, or a tight range.
- A verification system where every contractor is licensed, insured, and background-checked before network access, creating no delays or lapses in availability once onboarded.
- A documentation SOP that produces valuable insights for the property owners, from operations management, to materials cost and labor cost, as well as performance metrics for our network vendors.
- A scheduling and confirmation page on our site that guarantees 24-hour response for both parties. Emergencies can be handled within 4 hours.

### What Nexus Operations Is Not

- Not a lead generation service—project details are never sold to third parties
- Not a directory or referral platform—contractors do not compete for visibility or ranking
- Not a bidding marketplace—budget ceilings are set before any contractor sees the project

### Our USP

Exclusivity is enforced by essence, not as a policy or guideline. When a contractor is acquired for a project, the platform connects them with the client and provides each with documentation, metrics, and more—no surprises whatsoever.

### The Documentation Advantage

Every Nexus Operations project generates a complete record:
- Photographs of the work area (2 to 10 images)
- Written scope description provided by property owner
- Maximum budget ceiling set before contractor assignment
- Contractor assignment timestamp and contractor license verification (displayed on profile, with their tier level, years of experience, reviews from other clients, their availability and more)
- Consultation window selection and confirmation with one click, to streamline the scheduling (integrations with Google Calendar and Apple Calendar available)
- Benchmark estimates based on services to provide cost expectations prior to consultation

### Example Submission

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| Service category | Roofing |
| Scope | "Leak in northwest corner of roof following hailstorm. Water stain visible on ceiling in master bedroom. Roof is 18 years old, asphalt shingle." |
| Budget ceiling | $1,200 |
| Photographs | Exterior roof corner, interior ceiling stain, attic moisture evidence |
| Consultation windows | Thursday 2–4 PM, Friday 9–11 AM, Saturday 10 AM–12 PM |

This information is submitted once and is not distributed to multiple parties.

---

## 5 — HOW THE PLATFORM WORKS

### Step 1 — Property Owner Submits a Complete Project

### Step 2 — One Contractor Claims the Project Exclusively

Verified contractors in the relevant trade category and service area are notified that a new project is available. They review the complete submission—photographs, written scope, budget ceiling, and consultation windows—and decide whether the project fits their business.

**The contractor sees:**
- Complete project scope and photographs
- Maximum budget ceiling ($1,200 in this example)
- Property owner's selected consultation windows
- Geographic location (masked until claim to protect privacy)

One contractor claims it. The moment that claim is made, the project is permanently removed from every other contractor's view. The claiming contractor's dashboard updates to show the project as "Assigned to You" with property owner contact information and full project details.

### Step 3 — Consultation Confirmed Within 24 Hours

**Confirmation includes:**
- Contractor name, license number, insurance verification
- Confirmed consultation date and time
- Property address
- Reminder 24 hours before consultation

The contractor arrives having already reviewed the photographs, read the scope, and noted the budget ceiling. The conversation begins at a professional level—not with the contractor asking, "So what's the problem?" but with the contractor saying, "I reviewed the photographs and your description. Let me take a look at the roof and the attic moisture to assess the full scope."

### Step 4 — Agreement on Terms

The contractor provides a documented estimate. The estimate includes:
- Detailed scope of work
- Materials specifications
- Labor breakdown
- Timeline for completion
- Total cost

The property owner reviews the proposed scope, timeline, and cost. There is no obligation to proceed. If the estimate does not meet expectations, the property owner may decline without penalty, fees, or follow-up pressure. If the estimate is acceptable, the property owner accepts and the contractor schedules the work.

The entire transaction—from submission to consultation to estimate to decision—is documented in the platform at every stage.

## 6 — TARGET MARKETS AND CUSTOMER SEGMENTS

Nexus Operations serves property owners and operators of every kind. The common thread is not property type or portfolio size—it is the need for a reliable, documented, and professionally managed process for connecting with licensed contractor talent.

### Property Managers

Property managers overseeing residential portfolios, apartment complexes, multifamily buildings, or mixed-use properties use Nexus Operations to reduce the administrative burden associated with contractor coordination.

**Pain Points:**
- Manual contractor outreach and coordination across multiple vendors
- Lack of documentation for maintenance decisions when answering to property owners or boards
- Inconsistent response times from contractors
- Difficulty verifying contractor licensing and insurance before work begins
- No budget control mechanism before contractor contact

**Value Proposition:**
Nexus Operations produces professional-grade documentation automatically as a byproduct of every project submission. A property manager who can show their client a timestamped project submission with photographs, a defined budget ceiling, a contractor assignment record, and a consultation confirmation has documented their maintenance decision professionally. This is not available from any competitor platform.

### Homeowners

Homeowners undertaking roofing, concrete, HVAC, electrical, fencing, or tree removal work use Nexus Operations to identify a qualified contractor without navigating an open marketplace or managing competing contacts.

**Pain Points:**
- Overwhelm from receiving multiple contractor calls simultaneously
- Inability to evaluate contractor qualifications before contact
- Lack of budget transparency before scheduling consultations
- Wasted time meeting with contractors who quote above budget or lack reliability

### Short-Term Rental Operators

Operators of short-term rentals—including properties listed on Airbnb, VRBO, and similar platforms—cannot afford extended maintenance timelines.

**Pain Points:**
- Maintenance issues between bookings require immediate attention
- Guest complaints during stays require emergency contractor response
- Lost booking revenue during extended maintenance periods
- Difficulty coordinating contractor access when operator is not local

**Value Proposition:**
24-hour consultation confirmation minimizes lost booking revenue. Budget ceiling prevents scope creep and unexpected expenses. Documentation trail supports property damage claims and guest dispute resolution.

### Real Estate Investors

Investors managing acquisition-phase rehabilitation, pre-sale preparation, or ongoing portfolio maintenance use Nexus Operations to standardize contractor sourcing.

**Pain Points:**
- Inconsistent contractor quality across different markets or properties
- Lack of standardized documentation for rehab projects
- Difficulty tracking contractor expenses across portfolio
- Need for scalable contractor sourcing as portfolio grows

**Value Proposition:**
Standardized process applies to every property in the portfolio. Documentation supports accurate expense tracking and ROI analysis. Verified contractor network reduces risk of unqualified or uninsured work.

## 7 — TOPEKA MARKET ANALYSIS

Topeka, Kansas is the launch market. The opportunity is real, accessible, and structurally underserved.

### Market Fundamentals

| Metric | Data |
|---|---|
| Population | ~127,000 (Topeka city), ~175,000 (Shawnee County) |
| Median Home Age | 45 to 55 years—aging infrastructure drives consistent repair and replacement cycles |
| Rental Housing | ~42% of occupied housing units are rental properties |
| Cost of Living Index | 84 to 88 (national base = 100)—lower operating costs create favorable contractor economics |

### Weather-Driven Demand

Topeka's continental climate creates persistent, year-round contractor demand:
- 50 to 60 severe weather events annually generating insurance-related roofing claims and emergency tree removal
- 60 to 80 freeze-thaw cycles per year in Shawnee County accelerating concrete and foundation deterioration
- Summers averaging 98°F in July with heat indices above 100°F driving HVAC system demand
- Emerald ash borer infestation ongoing since ~2018 creating sustained, city-wide tree removal demand

### Key USP for Property Managers

For a property manager managing 40 units across 12 buildings who receives a maintenance complaint from a tenant and must document the response to the property owner within 24 hours, the Nexus audit trail is the difference between "I called some contractors and one came out" and "here is the timestamped submission with photographs, the verified contractor who was assigned, and the consultation that was confirmed for Thursday at 2 PM."

That difference is material when the property owner is evaluating whether to renew the property manager's contract.

### Barriers to Entry

1. **Two-sided marketplace, bootstrapped cold start** — Requires simultaneous supply and demand, and each side is reluctant to join without the other. Nexus solves this through staged sequencing (contractors first, property managers second).

2. **Contractor verification overhead** — Verifying license, insurance, and background for every contractor before network access is administratively intensive and requires compliance infrastructure. Most platforms avoid this by making verification self-service or optional.

3. **Local contractor relationships** — Topeka's market is limited by familiarity. There is limited room for growth when existing relationships dominate due to loyalty developed over time.

## 12 — GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY

### Phase 1 — Months 1 to 3: First 10 Projects

**Success metric:** 10 completed projects with documented outcomes and contractor/property owner testimonials.

### Phase 2 — Months 4 to 9: Market Penetration

**Success metric:** 20 property manager accounts with at least 1 submitted project each by end of Month 9. Minimum 10 completed projects with contractor and property owner testimonials.

### Phase 3 — Months 10 to 18: Scale and Expand

**Objective:** Reach 40 active contractors, begin market expansion preparation.

**HOA Management Company Focus:**
HOA management companies represent the revenue equivalent of 10 to 20 individual property managers. Topeka has 8 to 15 identifiable HOA management firms.

**Success metric:** 40 active contractors by Month 18, 5 HOA management companies converted, new location contractor network of 10+ assembled.

---

## 14 — RISK ANALYSIS AND MITIGATION

### Risk 1 — Contractor Churn if Project Volume is Low

**Reality:** If contractors pay $299 to $749 per month and claim no projects for 60 to 90 days, they will cancel their memberships.

**Mitigation:** Contractor acquisition is focused on roofing and tree removal during Kansas spring and summer season—the highest-demand period for both categories. Early contractors are recruited with the explicit expectation that project volume in the first 90 days will be modest but growing.

The membership economics remain favorable even at low claim rates. A roofing contractor paying $499/month who claims one project every two months at $9,000 average ticket still generates $4,000+ in net revenue per claimed project after membership cost—economically superior to purchasing shared leads at $60–$80 each with a one-in-four win rate.

**Validation Milestone:** Target: <20% churn in first 6 months. If churn exceeds 25%, introduce first-project guarantee (membership refund if no project claimed in first 60 days).

### Risk 2 — Geographic Concentration in Single Market

**Reality:** Nexus Operations is currently Topeka-only. If Topeka adoption is slower than projected or if a single large competitor enters the market, revenue growth could stall.

**Mitigation:** The raise funds second-market expansion by Month 15–18. The Topeka playbook is directly replicable: same service categories, same climate-driven demand, same property management and contractor market structure.

### Risk 3 — Dependency on Founder Execution

**Reality:** Nexus Operations is founder-led with limited team depth. If the founder is unavailable or unable to execute for an extended period, business momentum could stall.

**Mitigation:** The hire at Month 6 reduces single-point-of-failure risk. Additionally, the platform is designed to operate with minimal manual intervention once contractors and property managers are onboarded—project submissions, contractor notifications, and consultation confirmations are automated.

**Validation Milestone:** Document SOPs for contractor onboarding, property manager outreach, and platform support by Month 6.

---

## 15 — THE ASK

Nexus Operations is seeking **pre-seed capital structured as a SAFE note** with standard terms.

- **Raise:** $500,000
- **Discount:** 20%
- **Cap:** $5M
- **Timeline:** Close within 60 days of first investor commitment

### Why Nexus Operations is an Ideal Pre-Seed Investment

| Factor | Detail |
|---|---|
| Tech-enabled service model | Digital platform with managed marketplace structure |
| Heartland-rooted | Topeka-based founder with direct local market access |
| Capital efficient | Reaches break-even at Month 12 without continuous capital infusion |
| Check size alignment | $100K–$200K represents 20–40% of $500K round |

### The First 10 Projects

The first 10 completed projects are to be treated as the highest-priority business development activity in the first 90 days. Each one produces a documented outcome:

- Project type (roofing repair, tree removal, driveway concrete, etc.)
- Ticket value ($700, $1,100, $4,800, etc.)
- Timeline from submission to consultation confirmed
- Contractor experience testimonial
- Property owner experience testimonial

Those 10 verified case studies are the most valuable asset this company can produce before the next investor conversation. They demonstrate that the model works, and that property managers value the managed service, job completion, and the documentation.

### Next Steps for Investors

1. Introductory call with Brianna Gomez or Riley Garrison to review platform demo, company documents, licensing/certifications, finances, and pricing strategy
2. Access to platform sandbox environment for investor evaluation
3. Review of contractor pipeline data and property manager contact list (97 companies)
4. Discussion of SAFE note terms (20% discount, $5M cap) and closing timeline
